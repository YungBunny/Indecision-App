# Indecision-App

## About

This is my first web app written with React.js. 
Here I learned all about React components, stateless function components, component state, Webpack, styling with SCSS, and React Router. 
It's an app for the indecisive moments, you can input your choices, click the "What Should I Do?" button, and it generates a decision for you.
